# CMS CLI — `aliyun cms2`

## Prerequisite Check

> **Once per session**: perform this prerequisite check only on the **first** invocation of this skill in a conversation. If all checks already passed earlier in the same session, skip directly to the relevant module.

1. **Check `aliyun` exists** — `which aliyun` (macOS/Linux) or `where aliyun` (Windows).
    - Not found → ask the user to install the aliyun CLI first: <https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/121541.html>. Stop and wait.

2. **Check CLI version** — run `aliyun version`. Minimum required: **3.3.15** (see `compatibility` in frontmatter).

   > ⚠️ Compare version segments as **integers** (semver): 3.3.4 < 3.3.15 because 4 < 15.
   > Shell verification: `printf '%s\n' "3.3.15" "$(aliyun version)" | sort -V | head -1`
   > If the output equals the current version, the requirement is NOT met.

    - Version OK → go to step 3.
    - Version too old or unrecognized →
        1. Run `aliyun upgrade --help` to test whether the `upgrade` subcommand exists.
            - Available → run `aliyun upgrade -y` to update to the latest version automatically, then re-check `aliyun version`.
        2. If `upgrade` not available → ask the user to upgrade manually following the official guide: <https://help.aliyun.com/zh/cli/update-cli>. Wait for the user to confirm the upgrade is complete, then re-check `aliyun version`.
        3. If upgrade succeeded → go to step 3.
        4. If upgrade failed → ask the user to upgrade manually: <https://help.aliyun.com/zh/cli/update-cli>. Stop and exit.

3. **Check `cms2` plugin** — run `aliyun cms2 --help`.
    - Help output OK → continue to **Credentials**.
    - `unknown command` / missing → **stop immediately**, output the error report below (append CLI version, OS, and error message), and make **no further CLI calls**.

---

## Credentials

`aliyun cms2` reuses the aliyun CLI credential system (`aliyun configure`).
Use `--profile <name>` to switch profiles.

## Observability

Upon loading this skill, generate a random session ID (32-char lowercase hex string) once per session...

For every aliyun cms2 command, append:
--user-agent "AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cms-manage/{session-id}"

Local utility commands (e.g. `version`, `configure`, `plugin`, `--help`) do not support this flag and are excluded.

## Global Conventions

**Hard constraint**: fallback to `aliyun cms`, other API versions, or any workaround is strictly prohibited.

> **Run `aliyun cms2 <command> [subcommand] --help` before first use of a subcommand in a session** to get the full flag list and examples. Once the help for the same subcommand has been read in the current session and the command shape has not changed, reuse that knowledge instead of repeating the help call. A named subcommand's `--help` / `--show-schema` / `--show-example-body` is the authority for that command's flags, body envelope, response fields, and environment behaviour — do not search other skill files for a copy of those fields.

- **Prefer `-o text`** (default) to reduce token consumption for list/get; use `-o json` only when the output is parsed field by field rather than read.
- **Addon-release `values`**: expand each field's `fieldPath` into nested JSON as specified in [Addon Values Defaults](references/integration-common.md#addon-values-defaults-hard-requirement). Do not write a dotted `fieldPath` as one literal key. How to pick `--env-type`, where child fields sit on create vs update, and when a subset is (or is not) a valid body, are in that section.
- **Region parameter required for mutating and detail commands**: unless otherwise specified by a module-specific rule, all `create`, `update`, `delete`, and single-resource `get`/detail commands MUST include the `--region` parameter so the request is routed to the correct backend OpenAPI endpoint. Omitting `--region` on these commands may cause routing failures or operate against an unintended region, and the error can name something else entirely — `integration policy create` returns `status 400: The workspace can not be created` even when the workspace exists and the body is valid. This does not apply to `list`/query commands that intentionally span multiple regions (e.g. `entity query --source CloudResource` all-region queries). Requiring the flag is not permission to choose its value — resolve it per [Region Confirmation Gate](#region-confirmation-gate-hard-requirement).
- **One choice, one question**: every enumerated choice (region, workspace, policy, addon, scope mode, tag match mode, and any other mutually exclusive parameter) is asked as one question carrying **all** of its options. Never split them across questions or into a `（续）...` continuation, and never drop the ones that do not fit — a split turns one choice into two answers that can conflict or be left incomplete, and a truncated list hides valid choices entirely. When the structured input form cannot render every option, ask as plain text and spell out every option with its explanation in the question body. A mutually exclusive choice stays single-select; only a genuinely multi-valued one (several regions) is multi-select. A prompt may carry several distinct choices, each its own question. Put any recommended value directly in the option label (for example `(Recommended)`); recommendations are advisory only and do not permit cloud-side writes unless another rule permits defaulting or the user confirms.
- **Human confirmation required for writes and high-impact creates**: before any command that creates or changes cloud-side state (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `patch`, `start`, `stop`, etc.), show a concise confirmation summary and the exact command, ask whether the user confirms execution, and wait for a clear affirmative answer. The summary must include the operation, target resource identifiers, expected impact, and notable risks or irreversible effects when applicable. Do not require an exact phrase or long confirmation text; a clear affirmative answer such as "yes", "confirm", "proceed", or "确认" is sufficient approval. Skip confirmation only for dry-run, preview-only, or read-equivalent creates with no cloud-side impact; if uncertain, require confirmation.
- **Uncertain parameters must be explicitly answered by the user**: for any parameter whose value is not explicitly provided or cannot be reliably determined (e.g. `region`/`regionId`, workspace, policy, `resourceGroup`, tag, resource scope, `addon`/`addonName`, resource type, cloud product/service name, onboarding configuration options, etc.), ask the user for a clear answer before proceeding. Never fabricate, guess, infer from defaults/history, or arbitrarily choose one value. A module-specific reference may define narrow exceptions — for the integration module they are listed in [references/integration-common.md](references/integration-common.md#general-conventions). Changing an existing addon release's settings is an unrehearsable write: follow [Addon Release Config Update](references/integration-common.md#addon-release-config-update-hard-requirement).
- **A discovery query is not an answer**: a read command (`workspace list`, `entity query`, `policy list`, `sts get-caller-identity`, etc.) only builds the candidate set you present, and its output never becomes the user's answer — not when it returns a single candidate, not when a naming convention makes the value derivable, and not when an earlier turn of the session used one. "Reliably determined" means the user's own words or the resource they named pinned the value, not that the query happened to be unambiguous.
- **Name-to-ID lookup must match exactly**: when looking up a region ID, workspace ID, integration policy ID, resource group ID, resource type value, or cloud product/service name/code by name, if no exact match is found in the query results, do **not** silently pick an arbitrary value as a substitute. Instead, report the mismatch to the user and ask them to confirm or provide the correct value.

### Region Confirmation Gate (Hard Requirement)

Applies to **every** module and to every command that takes `--region` or a `region`/`regionId` body field. Settle the region **before** the workspace, since workspace verification is region-scoped.

List/query commands omit `--region` only when a module rule says the call is all-region. Omitting the flag is not all-region: the CLI supplies the profile default. Mutating and detail commands must carry it per [Region parameter required](#global-conventions).

There are exactly three legitimate sources for the value:

1. The user stated it in the current request — not an earlier unrelated turn of the same session.
2. The user picked it from a candidate list you presented, and you waited for that answer before running the next command.
3. The host injected it as runtime context (the console session's current region). Say which region you are operating on before using it.

Anything else is a violation, including: a CLI profile / `aliyun configure` / `ALIYUN_REGION` default, or an omitted required `--region`; the `cn-hangzhou` of docs and examples, or a region only stated in narration; splitting `default-cms-{userId}-{regionId}` (or any workspace name); passing `controlRegionId`.

A module may bind `--region` to the `regionId` of a resource the user already confirmed (named cluster, workspace that already passed this gate, instance). That is still Source 1 or 2. Module references do not loosen this.

**If Source 1 and 2 are absent**, present the region as a choice per [One choice, one question](#global-conventions) and stop. Gather candidates with `aliyun cms2 meta regions` and offer every `regionId` (never `showName` or `controlRegionId`); only consuming that output is wrong. Source 3, when present, is a recommended option only — it routes the call and does not decide scope. Onboarding region scope is collected by [Resource Scope Selection Gate](references/integration-common.md#resource-scope-selection-gate-hard-requirement); do not ask a second region question here.

`controlRegionId` is the control-plane region and may differ for dedicated / exclusive locations — never pass it as `--region`.

### Workspace Confirmation Gate (Hard Requirement)

Applies to **every** module and to every command that takes `--workspace` or a `workspace` body field. There are exactly three legitimate sources for the value:

1. The user stated it in the current conversation. Verify it exists in the target region by exact `workspaceName` match; no exact match → report and ask, never substitute a near match.
2. The user picked it from a candidate list you presented, and you waited for that answer before running the next command.
3. The environment supplied it as runtime context (e.g. the console session the skill runs inside) and its region matches the target region. Say which workspace you are operating on before using it.

Anything else is a violation: adopting the single row `aliyun cms2 workspace list` returned, picking the `default-cms-{userId}-{regionId}` entry because it looks like the account default, assembling that name from `aliyun sts get-caller-identity` plus a region, or reusing a workspace from an earlier unrelated request in the same session.

So `aliyun cms2 workspace list` remains the right way to gather candidates — only consuming its output instead of presenting it is wrong. Mark the best candidate `(Recommended)` inside the option per [One choice, one question](#global-conventions), then stop and wait.

Module references do not loosen this. Where one gives `default-cms-{userId}-{regionId}` as the workspace's "default format" or builds it from an account ID and a region, that describes how the account's default workspace is named — it is the candidate to recommend, never permission to skip the question.

## Pagination & Query Failure Handling

- **Paginate to completion**: for every `list` command that supports `--next-token`, keep querying until no `nextToken` remains or accumulated count ≥ `totalCount`. Do not trust the first page as complete when pagination metadata indicates more data.
- **Page size on paginated `list`**: when the command accepts `--max-results`, pass `100` and then paginate to completion. The 20-page cap times the CLI default page size can truncate a large policy list.
- **Accumulated count ≥ totalCount**: stop even if `nextToken` is non-empty or `truncated=true`; `totalCount` is the stronger signal.
- **Empty page with satisfied totalCount**: stop even if `nextToken` is present.
- **Token loop protection**: track seen tokens; stop on repeat and report as partial.
- **Page limit**: default 20 pages; report partial if reached.
- **Truncated results**: do not conclude absence from partial results. Use filters (`--search`, `--query`, `--policy-name`, etc.) or paginate fully.
- **Transient query failure**: retry once on a transient server-side error (`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, timeout); if it still fails, mark as `Unknown`/`QueryFailed` — do not treat as healthy or unhealthy.

## Error Handling

Error codes and actions are listed in `aliyun cms2 --help`. Additional tips:

- `InvalidJSON` usually means malformed `--body`; validate with `jq . <<<'<value>'` before passing to the CLI.
- `--body and stdin are mutually exclusive; specify only one` — means both `--body` (or `--file`) and stdin data were provided. Fix: keep only one input source. In agent/CI environments where stdin may be a pipe, append `< /dev/null` to the command to ensure stdin is empty.

## Output Language and Terminology

- Write user-facing explanations, analysis, recommendations, summaries, and conclusions in the user's language; default to Simplified Chinese when that language is unclear or mixed. Follow a mid-conversation switch from that point on, and let an explicit instruction about output language override both.
- Question prompts, option labels, table headers, and reports are user-facing text too — phrase them in the answer language even where a reference file spells them out in one language.
- CLI command names, flags, API paths, JSON field names, enum values, resource IDs, metric names, and log/error messages MUST remain verbatim English/code, whatever the answer language.
- Answering in English: use the Glossary's English column as the canonical vocabulary rather than inventing synonyms.
- Answering in Chinese: use the Glossary's Chinese terms in all prose, never leaving a mapped term in English. Write `中文（English）` on first mention only when it disambiguates, then the Chinese term alone. Before sending, scan for mapped English terms and replace them, except inside code, commands, JSON fields, IDs, or quoted CLI output.

Examples (Chinese answers):
- Good: `接入配置（AddonRelease，CLI 命令为 addon-release）`
- Good: `查询接入配置状态：aliyun cms2 integration addon-release list ...`
- Bad: `all releases are Ready`
- Better: `所有接入配置均 Ready`

## Metadata Query Mapping

| What You Need | How to Get It |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Metric business metadata** (namespaces & product codes via `meta namespaces`; metric name, type, unit, dimensions via `meta metrics`) | `meta namespaces` / `meta metrics` |
| **Prometheus labels, values & series inspection** | `metric promql labels` / `label-values` / `series` |

Integration-module lookups (resource metadata, onboarding status, policy-scoped Kubernetes resources, Prometheus instance by policy) live in [references/integration-common.md](references/integration-common.md#metadata-query-mapping).
