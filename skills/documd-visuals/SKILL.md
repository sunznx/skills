  Create visuals in Markdown documents: charts, diagrams, cards, architecture and page layouts.
  Charts and analytical views (bar, line, pie, heatmap, correlation, regression); reliability and
  operations (latency, incident, throughput, cycle time, OKR, standup, on-call); product and finance
  (funnel, retention, revenue, budget); process and workflow (approval, BPMN); software design and
  behaviour (class, state machine, sequence, C4); dependencies and impact (dependency graph, ER, causality);
  system architecture as an HTML page (layer stack, wings, zones, topology, service catalogue, request
  paths); infrastructure (cloud, Kubernetes, ETL, network, security, IAM, compliance); governance and people
  (ArchiMate, org chart, hiring); knowledge and planning (mind map, roadmap, Gantt, migration); documents
  (comparison, SWOT, memo, policy, catalogue, case study). Use when a document needs a diagram, chart or
  card. Not for slide decks or math notation, or for mermaid / canvas / drawio.

# documd visuals

Routing for every diagram, chart, card and layout this document pipeline can render.

## Iron rules

1. **Allowed fences** — `plantuml` / `puml` · `dot` · `vega` · `vega-lite` · `echarts` · `infographic`,
   plus **bare HTML** — which is how system architecture diagrams, cards and page layouts are drawn.
2. **Not recommended: `mermaid` · `canvas` · `drawio`.** Never write new content in them — use the
   engines above.
3. **One diagram per fence.** Do not put two engines in one block, and never nest fences.
4. **HTML is bare, never ` ```html `** — a fenced block becomes an image. Start from a real file rather
   than inventing one: [`layered-with-wings.md`](examples/system-architecture/layered-with-wings.md) for a
   system, [`executive-brief-summary.md`](examples/internal-documents/executive-brief-summary.md) for a card.
5. **Inline the data.** `vega` / `vega-lite` / `echarts` must carry their own `values` / `series` data;
   external URLs are unreliable on the export path.
6. **State the reading in the copy.** Every figure answers one question — put that question in the
   surrounding prose or the block's `title`.
7. **Pick a theme, then colour from it.** Colours come from one of the themes indexed in
   [`styles/palette.md`](styles/palette.md); copy that theme's block for your engine and take every
   value from it — a hex picked by hand, or two themes in one figure, is a bug. Charts pass the
   categorical ramp in order; cards use one accent plus neutrals.

## Engine cheat sheet

| Engine | Reach for it when | Look elsewhere when |
|---|---|---|
| `plantuml` | UML/ArchiMate/BPMN semantics or **brand and device icons** (9,514 stencils) | The layout should be computed (`dot`), or it is a chart |
| `dot` | A relationship graph should lay itself out: dependencies, causality, hierarchy, state machines | Icons or UML semantics matter |
| `vega` / `vega-lite` | The data needs work first — join, window, fold, regression, density, facets, small multiples | One polished chart with heavy styling (`echarts`) |
| `echarts` | Report-grade chart or KPI dashboard: axes, series, thresholds, annotations, gauges | The data must be transformed first |
| `infographic` | A designed-looking board: roadmap, timeline, checklist, comparison, quadrant, knowledge map | Axes, several series or statistical shapes (`echarts`) |
| HTML/CSS | Cards, memos, overviews, page-level layouts | Another engine already renders that diagram |

Details, limits and pitfalls: [`plantuml`](engines/plantuml.md) · [`dot`](engines/dot.md) ·
[`echarts`](engines/echarts.md) · [`vega`](engines/vega.md) · [`infographic`](engines/infographic.md) ·
[`html-css`](engines/html-css.md).

## Capability boundaries

These are **not possible**; pick the fallback instead of retrying.

| Want | Fallback |
|---|---|
| 3D / globe / WebGL charts (no `echarts-gl`) | 2D `echarts`; `scatter`/`graph` for shape |
| Geographic maps (no bundled map data, no GeoJSON offline) | schematic `dot` layout, or an HTML/CSS region diagram |
| `dataset.transform` in ECharts (throws `RangeError` in 6.1.0) | sort and derive upstream, then `dataset.source` |
| Functions in an `echarts` option (parsed as JSON) | template strings (`"{c}%"`), per-item label objects |
| External data or images (`data.url`, remote URLs) | inline `values`, data URLs |
| PlantUML WBS / Salt / Timing / ditaa / JSON / YAML / EBNF / nwdiag / SDL / math (parse, draw nothing useful) | `@startmindmap`, `dot` tree, HTML/CSS mockups, or a code fence |
| Interactive charts (tooltip, zoom, brush) | annotate directly: labels, thresholds, callouts |
| Icons in `dot` / `vega` / `echarts` | `plantuml` stencils |
| Free-form positioning in `infographic` | HTML/CSS for pixel control |

## Converting a document

The **`documd` CLI** does three things the host application cannot: **convert** a document or a diagram
source to a file, **extract** its figures as image files to look at (`--assets ./figures`), and
**verify** — rendering is the only way to prove a block draws; every failure comes back with its engine
and markdown line, and the run exits 1. Nothing to install:
`npx @markdown-viewer/documd in.md out.docx` (`.pdf` · `.epub` · `.html`, `diagram.puml out.png`).
⚠️ Use the scope: bare `documd` on npm is a **different package**. Flags, formats and export
behaviour: [converting.md](converting.md).

## When a block does not render

1. Fence in the allowed list? Exactly one block per figure?
2. Is it a listed anti-pattern in that engine's reference (see **Engine cheat sheet**) — or strict
   syntax (JSON for `echarts`/`vega`, no empty lines in bare HTML)?
3. Then switch to the alternative engine named in the goal guide; most scenarios have two implementations.
4. Or verify by rendering: `npx @markdown-viewer/documd file.md --assets /tmp/figs`.

## Where everything lives

[`catalog/scenarios.md`](catalog/scenarios.md) indexes every scenario with its domain, engines, tier and
example path — start there; then `goals/<domain>.md`, `engines/<engine>.md`, `examples/<domain>/<file>.md`.
